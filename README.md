# Mapping_Earthquakes Module and Challenge
we used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a provided URL. Each earthquake isrepresented by a circle and color, where as a higher magnitude retains a larger diameter and is darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data. We added the USGS URL for earthquake data by navigating to the USGS Hazards Program, clicking the Earthquakes link to open the Real-time Data Feeds link and scrolled down to "GeoJSON Summary" Feed. There, we clicked the All Earthquakes link under the “Past 7 Days” heading

The Challenege excited the student due to the fact it has actual business opportunity potential. 

Challenge goals which were accomplished:

Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.

Thank you for your time,
